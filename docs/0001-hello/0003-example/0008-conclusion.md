title: Conclusion

There you have it&mdash;you were able to build a complete app with just a few lines of HTML. Pakyow uses a built-in tool called Reflection to understand the semantic intent of your view templates and then bootstraps a working backend (a "reflection") for your interface. From here, you can extend the reflection to add any custom features that you might need.

We covered a lot of ground in this example, introducing several concepts including view composition, data bindings, and Reflection. Use the links below to learn more about the parts of the framework that we covered here:

* Frontend: Are you a frontend designer or developer? Start here to learn about view composition and data bindings, as well as topics we skipped such as the asset pipeline.

* Backend: More of a backend developer? Start here to learn about the various backend aspects such as routing, data sources, and presenters.

* Reflection: Intrigued by Reflection? Start here to learn more about how it works, then move on to the frontend or backend documentation.

Thanks for reading! We can't wait to see what you build.
