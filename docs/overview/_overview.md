*Pakyow helps you build modern applications that don't break the Web.*

In his essay, [The World Wide Web: A very short personal
history](https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/ShortHistory.html), Tim
Berners-Lee states:

> The dream behind the Web is of a common information space in which we
  communicate by sharing information. Its universality is essential: the fact
  that a hypertext link can point to anything, be it personal, local or global,
  be it draft or highly polished.

Users of the modern web prefer interactive experiences over static content. To
accomplish this, many developers have chosen to move some or all of their
application to the client. Rather than responding with the requested document,
the server responds with JavaScript that (hopefully) renders the requested
document. In the client-side Web, a url most often points at a blank page. *The
client-side model breaks the Web.*

Pakyow lets you build interactive user experiences that sit on top of a
traditional, server-driven stack. Conceptually, it falls somewhere between a
traditional framework (e.g. Ruby on Rails) and a more modern, client-side
framework (e.g. Ember.js).

With Pakyow, code is written in Ruby and is executed on the server, where
initial rendering occurs. Once a page is presented in the web browser, Pakyow
keeps the presented view in sync with the latest server-side state. *It does
this without moving any code to the client.*

Pakyow is simply a layer on top of the server-driven architecture that has
powered the Web for decades, making it a natural step forward from a traditional
Web framework. **Pakyow is the realtime Web implemented as a progressive
enhancement.**
