# Guidelines

In an effort to keep final editing to a minimum, here are some
guidelines to follow when writing content:

**Be clear but not elementary.** A beginner should be able to read the docs and 
understand how to use Pakyow, but the concepts should be described for what they 
are and in terms a seasoned developer can relate to.

**Include examples as necessary** (look at an existing file for a formatting
example). If the example produces meaningful output, include the output
as a code comment at the end of the example.

**Add references to related concepts as applicable.** This includes
references to other Pakyow docs as well as core Ruby or general
programming concepts. When making a reference be sure to include some
details on how the reference relates to the current topic.

**Feel free to break up content.** If content for a particular topic
needs to be broken up, do so with level four headings. See Routing
Overview for an example.

**Keep the narrative consistent.** Refer to the reader the-second person and
Pakyow (framework or team) in third-person.

**Denote what is code.** When referencing a symbol (e.g. class,
method) wrap in tildes so it is formatted as `code`. If a particular
class/method is being referenced format as `ClassName#method_name`. If
the context is implied (e.g. the method for defining a GET route), do
not include the class name.
