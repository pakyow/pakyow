module Pakyow
  module Routing
    # Executes code for particular requests. For example:
    #
    #   Pakyow::Application.controller do
    #     get "/" do
    #       # called for GET / requests
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # A +Class+ is created dynamically for each defined controller. When matched, a route is called in
    # context of its controller. This means that any method defined in a controller is available to be
    # called from within a route. For example:
    #
    #   Pakyow::Application.controller do
    #     def foo
    #     end
    #
    #     get :foo, "/foo" do
    #       foo
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # Including modules works as expected:
    #
    #   module AuthHelpers
    #     def current_user
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    #   Pakyow::Application.controller do
    #     include AuthHelpers
    #
    #     get :foo, "/foo" do
    #       current_user
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # See {Application.controller} for more details on defining controllers.
    #
    # = Supported HTTP methods
    #
    # - +GET+
    # - +POST+
    # - +PUT+
    # - +PATCH+
    # - +DELETE+
    #
    # See {get}, {post}, {put}, {patch}, and {delete}.
    #
    # +HEAD+ requests are handled automatically via {Rack::Head}.
    #
    # = Building paths for named routes
    #
    # Path building is supported via {Controller#path} and {Controller#path_to}.
    #
    # = Reusing logic with actions
    #
    # Methods can be defined as additional actions for a route. For example:
    #
    #   Pakyow::Application.controller do
    #     action :called_before
    #
    #     def called_before
    #       ...
    #     end
    #
    #     get :foo, "/foo" do
    #       ...
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # = Extending controllers
    #
    # Extensions can be defined and used to add shared routes to one or more controllers.
    # See {Routing::Extension}.
    #
    # = Other routing features
    #
    # More advanced route features are available, including groups, namespaces, and templates. See
    # {group}, {namespace}, and {template}.
    #
    # = Controller subclasses
    #
    # It's possible to work with controllers outside of Pakyow's DSL. For example:
    #
    #   class FooController < Pakyow::Routing::Controller("/foo")
    #     default do
    #       # available at GET /foo
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    #   Pakyow::Application.controller << FooController
    #
    # = Custom matchers
    #
    # Controllers and routes can be defined with a matcher rather than a path. The matcher could be a
    # +Regexp+ or any custom object that implements +match?+. For example:
    #
    #   class CustomMatcher
    #     def match?(path)
    #       path == "/custom"
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    #   Pakyow::Application.controller CustomMatcher.new do
    #   end
    #
    # Custom matchers can also make data available in +params+ by implementing +match+ and returning
    # an object that implements +named_captures+. For example:
    #
    #   class CustomMatcher
    #     def match?(path)
    #       path == "/custom"
    #     end
    #
    #     def match(path)
    #       return self if match?(path)
    #     end
    #
    #     def named_captures
    #       { foo: "bar" }
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    #   Pakyow::Application.controller CustomMatcher.new do
    #   end
    #

        # Creates a route template with a name and block. The block is evaluated within a

        # namespace).
        #
        # Route templates are used to define a scaffold of default routes that will later be expanded
        # at some path. During expansion, the scaffolded routes are also mapped to routing logic.
        #
        # Because routes can be referenced by name during expansion, route templates provide a way to
        # create a domain-specific-language, or DSL, around a routing concern. This is used within
        # Pakyow itself to define the resource template ({Routing::Extension::Resource}).
        #
        # @example Defining a template:
        #   Pakyow::Application.controller do
        #     template :talkback do
        #       get :hello, "/hello"
        #       get :goodbye, "/goodbye"
        #     end
        #   end
        #
        # @example Expanding a template:
        #
        #   Pakyow::Application.controller do
        #     talkback :en, "/en" do
        #       hello do
        #         send "hello"

        #       goodbye do

        #       end
        #
        #       # we can also extend the expansion
        #       # for our particular use-case
        #       get "/thanks" do
        #         send "thanks"

        #
