module Pakyow
  module Runnable
    # Performs work in a system service created by a parent container.
    #
    # @example
    #   Pakyow.container :some_container do
    #     service :some_service do
    #       def perform
    #         until stopped? do
    #           puts "hello"

    # = Restartability
    #
    # Services are restartable by default, meaning the container will restart services that exit
    # until the container itself is stopped. Restartability can be disabled for a service by
    # defining the service with `restartable: false`:
    #
    #   Pakyow.container :some_container do
    #     service :some_service, restartable: false do
    #       ...
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # Restartability can be determined at runtime by overloading the `restartable?` instance method:
    #
    #   Pakyow.container :some_container do
    #     service :some_service do
    #       def restartable?
    #         [true, false].sample
    #       end
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # = Service Limits
    #
    # Services can be started any number of times by default, as defined by the container's current
    # formation. Limits can be imposed on a service by defining the service with `limit: {n}`:
    #
    #   Pakyow.container :some_container do
    #     service :some_service, limit: 1 do
    #       ...
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # Limits can be determined at runtime by overloading the `limit` instance method:
    #
    #   Pakyow.container :some_container do
    #     service :some_service do
    #       def limit
    #         [1, 2].sample
    #       end
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # = Prerun / Postrun
    #
    # Services running in a top-level container have their `prerun` method invoked when the container
    # runs. This methods receives the container's run options, giving the service an opportunity to
    # add its own options for later use. Similarly, `postrun` is called  when the container stops.
