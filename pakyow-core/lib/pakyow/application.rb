module Pakyow
  # Pakyow's main application object. Can be defined directly or subclassed to
  # create multiple application objects, each containing its own state. These
  # applications can then be mounted as an endpoint within the environment.
  #
  #   Pakyow::Application.define do
  #     # state shared between all apps goes here
  #   end
  #
  #   class API < Pakyow::Application
  #     # state for this app goes here
  #   end
  #
  #   Pakyow.configure do
  #     mount API, at: "/api"
  #   end
  #
  # = Pipeline
  #
  # Requests are received by {Application#call}, creating a {Connection} object that
  # provides an interface to the underlying request state. The connection is
  # pushed through a pipeline. Each pipeline action can modify the connection
  # and then either 1) allow the connection to hit the next action 2) halt
  # pipeline execution completely.
  #
  # Once the connection exits the pipeline a response is returned. If an action
  # halted, the connection is finalized and returned, otherwise app assumes
  # that the connection was unhandled and returns a canned 404 response.
  #
  # Application also catches any unhandled errors that occur in the pipeline by simply
  # logging the error and returning a canned 500 response.
  #
  # @see Support::Pipeline
  #
  # = Configuration
  #
  # Application objects can be configured.
  #
  #   Pakyow::Application.configure do
  #     config.name = "my-app"
  #   end
  #
  # It's possible to configure for certain environments.
  #
  #   Pakyow::Application.configure :development do
  #     config.name = "my-dev-app"
  #   end
  #
  # The +app+ config namespace can be extended with your own custom options.
  #
  #   Pakyow::Application.configure do
  #     config.foo = "bar"
  #   end
  #
  # @see Support::Configurable
  #
  # = Hooks
  #
  # Hooks can be defined for the following events:
  #
  #   - initialize
  #   - configure
  #   - load
  #   - finalize
  #   - boot
  #   - rescue
  #   - shutdown
  #
  # Here's how to log a message after initialize:
  #
  #   Pakyow::Application.after "initialize" do
  #     logger.info "initialized #{self}"
  #   end
  #
  # @see Support::Hookable
  #
  class Application
    # Environment the app is booted in, e.g. +:development+.
    #
    attr_reader :environment

    # Application mount path.
