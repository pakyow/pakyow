  module Support
    # Provides control over how state is defined on an object, and how state is
    # shared across object instances and subclasses.
    #
    # You define the type of state provided by an object, along with any global
    # state for that object type. When an instance is created or the definable
    # object is subclassed, the new object inherits the global state and can be
    # extended with its own state.
    #
    # Once an instance has been created, global state for that object is frozen.
    #
    # Defineable objects' `initialize` method should always call super with
    # the block to ensure that state is inherited correctly.
    #
    # @example
    #   class SomeDefineableObject
    #     include Support::Defineable
    #
    #     def initialize(some_arg, &block)
    #       # Do something with some_arg, etc.
    #
    #       super(&block)
    #     end
    #   end
